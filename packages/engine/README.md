## Getting Started

### Create a Collection

```js
import { AlwatrNitrobase, Region } from '@alwatr/nitrobase';

const alwatrStore = new AlwatrNitrobase({
  rootPath: './db',
  defaultChangeDebounce: 2_000, 
});

const postsCollectionId = {
  name: 'post',
  region: Region.PerUser,
  ownerId: 'user_123',
  schemaVer: 2,
};

alwatrStore.newCollection(postsCollectionId);

const postsCollection = await alwatrStore.openCollection(postsCollectionId);

postsCollection.addItem('post1', {
  title: 'My First Post',
  content: 'This is the content of my first post.'
});
```

### Create a Document

```js
import { AlwatrNitrobase, Region } from '@alwatr/nitrobase';

const alwatrStore = new AlwatrNitrobase({
  rootPath: './db',
  defaultChangeDebounce: 2_000, 
});

const docId = {
  name: 'posts/my-first-post',
  region: Region.Authenticated,
};

alwatrStore.newDocument(docId, {
  title: 'My First Post',
